Over the past 16 years, the food company has strengthened the presence of its product lines (Thnot, Kirum, Jaya, KEM) in numerous markets at the local and international level and on every continent. Beyond its organic Kampot pepper and Kampong Speu palm sugar under the GI label, the food company has developed a wide range of products (for must of them organic farmed and certificated by Ecocert under European, American and Japanese standards) and 7 family products : Kampot peppers, Palm sugar and syrups, Candies, Vinegars and sauces, Palm Wines and Spirits, Wellness Herbal Teas, Probiotics. With a strict quality control that begins at its own laboratory in Chom Chao, and then at the Pasteur Institute of Cambodia, Camcontrol, LNCG and CIRAD in France, with whom Confirel works closely, Confirel guarantees the safety and the quality of its products.\n\u00a0\nBACKGROUND\n\u00a0\nConfirel was founded in 2001 by Dr. Hay Ly Eang, a Khmer-French pharmacist and herbalist who is guided by a strong conviction:\u00a0the rural development and the improvement of farmers\u2019 living conditions are the keystone of a prosperous and peaceful future for the generations to come and his country, Cambodia. Confirel\u2019s first major goal was to demonstrate that the development of high value added products grown in local soils is the major condition to develop the country, to reduce rural exodus and social inequities and, above all, to improve farmers\u2019 incomes and living conditions. Building close relationships with stakeholders such as rural communities and technical assistants, Confirel has won its bet. Confirel\u2019s organic palm sugar, the food company\u2019s guiding light on the road to excellence, received in 2005 the \u201cPalme d\u2019Or Award\u201d at the Natexpo Salon in Paris, a real worldwide recognition that shows the real potentiel of Authentic Khmer products on the international stage.\n\u00a0\nConfirel\u2019s commitment \u00a0and its societal goals, specifically those relating \u00a0to economic and rural development, education and training, has been rewarded at the local and international level. The Asian Development Bank and the World Bank have recognized the food company as a Business model for sustaina- ble development. Confirel was also honored in 2016 by the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Award for its outstanding contribution \u00a0to the sustaina- ble economic development of Cambodia. As pointed out by the President of the French Foreign Trade Advisors in Cambodia, who has organized this Prize with the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Labor and Vocational training, the Ministry of Environment, the Council for the development of Cambodia and the French Embassy, \u201c\u201dCSR work will surely benefit not only this gener- ation of Cambodians but many generations to come\u201d\u201d.

Dewey International Co., LTD was also set up in order to provide foreign lan\u00acguage programs and job oriented diplomas. Another purpose of Dewey International Co., LTD was to run a K-12 school named Dewey International School (DIS) under Prakas No. 102 of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport signed by the Minister.

The Siamese crocodile and Asian elephant still survive in the country\u2019s lush forest refuges.\nAs Cambodia\u2019s economy is developing, once inaccessible forest areas now face multiple threats from logging, mining, poaching and agricultural encroachment.

The goal of the society was to safeguard the future of southern Africa\u2019s large mammal populations, which had declined alarmingly due to over-hunting and habitat encroachment. Working in tandem with landowners, government and sport hunters, the Society helped pass legislation which controlled hunting in vast stretches of East Africa and South Africa. This ultimately paved the way for the formation of National Parks, such as Kruger National Park and Serengeti National Park.\nFFI has been referred to by many historians as the world's first conservation society, and the society's early work in Africa was also trend-setting in ecotourism.", "company_name": "Fauna & Flora International (FFI)", "created_at": "2018-04-26"}, {"company_logo": "http://eurocham-cambodia.org/images/members/logos/76b57-logo-remoissenet-patrimoine-(2)-(2).jpg", "company_contacts": [{"name": "Philippe Remoissenet", "phone": null, "designation": "Director", "email": null, "profile_picture": "http://eurocham-cambodia.org/images/pages/"}], "company_emails": ["philippe@remoissenet.net"], "uid": "http://eurocham-cambodia.org/member/175/Fermire-Remoissenet-SAS", "company_address": {"street": null, "full_name": "10 Rue du Mont Thabor\n75001 PARIS, FRANCE", "state": null, "city": null}, "company_website": null, "company_phones": ["+33 (0)1 40 07 00 00"], "company_description": "ACTIVITIES\nRemoissenet SARL, founded in 1997, subsidiary of the group Fermi\u00e8re Remoissenet SAS, offers creation and gestion of customized wealth management service for private French and non French clients.

The DEF offers to the companies a service of pre-recruitment. (identification of the candidates, selection of CVs).
